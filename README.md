# ARKit Face Tracking Demo

This repo contains a basic setup for detecting faces using ARKit and rendering a 3D face mesh using SceneKit.

The demo also shows how to attach nodes to specific vertices on the face geometry.

Using [FaceLandmarks.com](https://facelandmarks.com), ARKit developers can easily identify specific facial landmarks using a browser-based free tool.

ARKit's face geometry representation contains a set of 1,220 vertices and 6,912 triangle indices. These vertices, however, are not documented by Apple and it can be tedious to identify specific facial landmarks.

With [FaceLandmarks.com](https://facelandmarks.com), you can browse and explore a 3D face mesh rendering to easily identify vertices for your ARKit face tracking project.
